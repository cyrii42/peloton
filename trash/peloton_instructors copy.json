The moment someone says he can’t do something, well, that’s all he needs to hear to go out and do it! It’s why he’s often been labelled a rebel as he always manages to find a way to overcome life’s obstacles by doing things his way. After a decade in New York, Bradley is now back in the UK to bring his unique blend of British charm and eternally optimistic attitude to the London cycling studio. He’s a big believer that life is an adventure we shouldn’t take too seriously, so expect him to keep you smiling through his sweat-drenched sessions on the Bike.",
